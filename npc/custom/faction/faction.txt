					next;

					mes "^0000FFThe United Empire of Netoria^000000 was formed under the valiance of its Primal Lord, ^0000FFNetori^000000, after the gods of Motenia failed to destroy all life.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "Due to the devastation, ^0000FFNetoria^000000 gave the world its greatest period of time, and let it cultivate its people even more.";

					mes "With the passing of the great Lord, his chosen, the two greatest Netorians to ever grace its palace - ^0000FFJeff Saber^000000, The Last Exile, and ^FF0000ReDGuRL^000000, The Light of Netoria - begin to carry out his will.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "The new Lord, ^0000FFJeff Saber^000000, began reigniting the passion of everyone, Netorian or not, so that they could forge their own paths with greater fortitude.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "However, ^FF0000The Light of Netoria^000000 saw that ^0000FFSaber^000000's darkness grew, despite all the effort they both put into keeping it at bay.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "Eventually, she let go of the authority given to her by ^0000FFNetori^000000's will, and set off to found a ^FF0000new empire^000000 of her own.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "Deeply saddened by this, ^0000FFSaber^000000 vows to get even stronger than they were before, in hopes of crossing paths with ^FF0000her^000000 again.";

					mes "As ^FF0000ReDGuRL^000000 travelled the world, she encountered a rogue vicar named ^FF0000Mabel^000000, who tries to sell her her goods.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "Instead of just buying ^FF0000Mabel^000000's stuff, she insisted on helping her out on some errands. The two quickly gained each other's trust and became friends.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "With the money they raised from retail, ^FF0000Mabel^000000 eventually bought a very large expanse of land due east of ^0000FFNetorian Territory^000000.";

					mes "Using most of her strength, ^FF0000ReDGuRL^000000 created a multitude of terrain, cities to be populated, flora, and fauna.";

					mes "She was pleased, and she named ^FF0000Mabel^000000's land ^FF0000Iruna^000000, as she was also mourning the loss of a loved one, and she feels like shutting in.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "One day, one of ^FF0000Mabel's acquaintances^000000, an assassin named ^FF0000Binx Eclair^000000, is hired by bandits to kill ^FF0000ReDGuRL^000000 in her weakened state.";

					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";
					mes "Instead, she saw her eyes - lifeless as they are - and sheathed back her blade. Reflecting on her vow to ^FF0000Mabel^000000 never to kill anyone who is broken, she promises the ^FF0000High Empress^000000 to help her find herself again.";
					next;
					mes "[Herald of Destiny]";

He misunderstands this and sees it as a dire threat, and prepares the ^FF0000Red Empire^000000 for combat, without knowing the enemy fully, and with the ^FF0000High Empress^000000' powers not yet fully recovered.";
