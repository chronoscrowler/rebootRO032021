// Skill Times Database
//
// Structure of Database:
// SkillID,CastingTime,AfterCastActDelay,AfterCastWalkDelay,Duration1,Duration2,Cool Down,Fixed Casting Time
//
// CastingTime: time to cast this skill, in miliseconds
// AfterCastActDelay: "normal" delay, character cannot use skills, in miliseconds
// AfterCastWalkDleay: amount of time before character can move again, in miliseconds
// Duration1/Duration2: usually the durations used by the skill, at special cases it is used to hold special data
// Cool Down: amount of time until character can re-use this skill, in miliseconds
// Fixed Casting Time: the skills fixed casting time (when 0, uses 20% of cast time and less than 0 means no fixed cast time)
//
// On all fields you can use ':' as a delimiter for level-specific values.
// For example:
// - Original: 6,0,0,0,30000,0,1000
// - Modified: 6,0,0,0,30000,0,1000:2500:3000:...
// Gives Level 1 1000ms cool down, Level 2 2500ms, Level 3 3000ms, and so on.
